## Language Specific Resources

*List of language specific projects, libraries, frameworks and other resources.*

* [.NET](https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet): The .NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows and provides language interoperability across several programming languages.

* [C/C++](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp): C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

* [C](https://github.com/aleksandar-todorovic/awesome-c): C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, recursion and a statically typed language.

* [Common Lisp](https://github.com/kozross/awesome-cl): LISP is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized Polish prefix notation.

* [D](https://github.com/zhaopuming/awesome-d): The D programming language is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language

* [Delphi](https://github.com/Fr0sT-Brutal/awesome-delphi): Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) for console, desktop graphical, web, and mobile applications.

* [Elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir): Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang to provide distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, non-stop applications.

* [Erlang](https://github.com/drobakowski/awesome-erlang): Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, garbage-collected programming language and runtime system.

* [Fortran](https://github.com/rabbiabram/awesome-fortran): Fortran is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.

* [Go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go): Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google and is a statically-typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C

* [Groovy](https://github.com/kdabir/awesome-groovy): Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is a dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby and Perl. It can be used as a scripting language for the Java Platform.

* [Haskell](https://github.com/krispo/awesome-haskell): Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing.

* [HTML5](https://github.com/diegocard/awesome-html5)

* [Java](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java): Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

* [JavaScript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript): JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.

* [Julia](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl)

* [Lua](https://github.com/LewisJEllis/awesome-lua)


* [OCaml](https://github.com/rizo/awesome-ocaml)

* [Perl](https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl): Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.

* [Phalcon](https://github.com/sergeyklay/awesome-phalcon)

* [PHP](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php): PHP is a server-side scripting language and designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.

* [Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python): Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

* [R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R)

* [Rails](https://github.com/ekremkaraca/awesome-rails)

* [Ruby](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby)
